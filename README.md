# EDSM-RSE plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki)

Elite: Dangerous Star Map - Red Star Eleminator (EDSM-RSE) is a plugin that displays the name and distance to a nearby system, that is on EDSM but is missing coordinates (therefore being displayed as red system).

Systems without coordinates originate from a time, when there was no journal file. Explorers would upload their flight path to EDSM by sending only the system name. Back then, manual trilateration was required to determine where the system is located in the galaxy. Because this was a lengthy and annoying process only a small percentage of the systems back then had coordinates associated to them.

## Installation

1. On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the _Open_ button. This reveals the _plugins_ folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Thurion/EDSM-RSE-for-EDMC/releases).
3. Open the _.zip_ archive that you downloaded and move the _EDSM-RSE_ folder contained inside into the _plugins_ folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin.

## Usage

A few settings can be configured:
* The radius
    * Set the radius to 1000 Ly or less in regions where with many systems without coordinates. If you don't get any results, choose a larger radius. But be aware that a radius of 4000 in a region of many systems without coordinates will result in poorer performance of the plugin as there are more distances have to calculated and stored in memory.
* How often the plugin will check for systems without coordinates
    * 1 means it will check for systems after every jump and 7 will do so only every 7 jumps. A few things happen on an update: 
	    1. Get systems that match the radius from the local database
		2. Calclate the distance to all of them
		3. Ask EDSM for the closest 15 systems if they are still missing coordinates. This happens up to 3 times for a total of up to 45 systems. A particular system is checked once every hour at most.
		4. If there are any nearby systems left in the list, show the closest systems with an estimated distance to it and copy the name to the clipboard if it is turned on.
* Whether to copy the system name to clipboard or not

Using this plugin only makes sense when the system locations are transmitted via EDDN or directly to EDSM. The plugin won't do anything if neither one is turned on. To overwrite that behavior, check that another tool is used to transmit the data.

## Manual Database Update

1. Download the new *systemsWithoutCoordinates.sqlite* from [Rapidfire's Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8m8o5ondnjctovs/AACaB0qr4j0mU3Vd9FrTi1bna?dl=0)
2. Open the EDSM-RSE folder within plugins as described above
3. Close EDMC
4. Move the downloaded file and overwrite the existing one
5. Start EDMC again
